Full objective: "Compare and contrast concepts and strategies to protect data."

### Data Types and Classifications
- Types
	- Regulated: managed by a third party - government laws and statutes
	- Trade secret: organizations' "secret formulas" - often unique
	- Intellectual property: publicly visible but copyrighted/trademarked
	- Legal information: records, documents, info - contains PII
	- Financial information: internal financial details, payment records, payment medium data, etc.
	- Human-readable: understandable, clear and obvious
	- Non-human-readable: not easily understood, encoded data
		- Some are a hybrid (CSV, JSON, etc.)
- Classifying sensitive data
	- Different sensitivities require different security and handling
	- Stronger network, DMZ, MFA, etc.
- Classifications
	- Proprietary: property of an organization
	- PII - Personally Identifiable Information: used to identify an individual
	- PHI - Protected Health Information: health info used to identify an individual or associated with an individual
	- Sensitive: intellectual property, S/PII, PHI
	- Confidential: VERY sensitive, approved to view
	- Public/Unclassified: no restrictions
	- Private/Classified/Restricted: restricted access, may require NDA
	- Critical: data that should always be accessible
### States of Data
- Data at rest: on a storage device
	- Encrypt the data - whole disk, database, file-/folder-level
	- Apply permissions
- Data in transit/motion: being transmitted over the network
	- Not much protection as it travels
	- Network-based protection - firewall, IPS
	- Provide transport encryption - TLS, IPsec
- Data in use: actively processing in memory (system RAM, CPU)
	- Data is almost always decrypted
	- Attackers pick the decrypted information out of RAM
	- Target breach November 2013, attackers picked credit card numbers out of point-of-sale RAM
- Data sovereignty: data that resides in a country is subject to the laws of that country
	- Laws may prohibit where data is stored
	- GDPR - data collected on EU citizens must be stored in the EU
	- Compliance laws may prohibit data moving out of the country
- Geolocation: location details
	- Many ways to determine - 802.11, mobile providers, GPS
	- Can be used to manage access
		- Limited administrative tasks unless secure area is used
### Protecting Data
- Geographic restrictions
	- Network location: IP or subnet, difficult with mobile devices
	- Geolocation: GPS, 802.11 wireless, IP address (most to least accurate)
	- Geofencing: automatically determine access based on location
- Protecting data
	- Primary important job task, but data is everywhere
	- Encrypt, employ permissions
- Encryption: encode information into unreadable data
	- Two-way: able to convert between one and the other
	- Confusion: encrypted data is drastically different than plaintext
- Hashing: represent data as a short string of test (message digest, fingerprint, etc.)
	- One-way: impossible to recover original message, used to store passwords
	- Verify a downloaded document is the same as the original
	- Can be a digital signature (with public-key crypto)
	- Will not (usually) have collision
- Obfuscation: make something normally understandable difficult to understand
	- Take readable code and turn it into nonsense
	- Helps prevent the search for security holes (malware, etc.)
	- Not a good technique for securing on-premises data, security-by-obscurity isn't very powerful
- Masking: type of obfuscation, hides some of the original data
	- Protects PII and other sensitive data
	- Example: showing only last 4 digits of credit/debit card number, replace the rest of asterisks
	- May only be hidden from view, could still be in storage
- Tokenization: replace sensitive data with non-sensitive placeholder
	- Common with credit card processing
	- Not encryption or hashing - original data and token not related mathematically
- Segmentation
	- Spread data among many servers/locations, no central point of failure
	- Some data should also have stronger security
- Permission restrictions
	- Control access to an account
	- Auth process then permissions once in account
