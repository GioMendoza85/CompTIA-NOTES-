Full objective: "Explain the importance of change management processes
and the impact to security."

### Change Management
- Upgrading software, patching an application, changing firewall configuration, modifying switch ports, etc.
- One of the most common and frequent risks and enterprise, must be standardized
- **Change approval process**: a formal process for making change
	1. Complete request forms
	2. Determine purpose of change
	3. Identify scope of change
	4. Schedule a date and time
	5. Determine affected systems and impact
	6. Analyze risk associated with change
- Ownership
	- Individual or entity needs to make a change - they own the process but don't perform the actual change
	- Owner manages the change process, is informed of updates and must test their system afterward
- Stakeholders - who is impacted by this change?
- Impact analysis
	- Determine a risk value (high, medium, low)
	- What risks can occur upon making the change? What about NOT making the change?
- Test results - sandbox testing environment
	- Technological "safe space"
	- Use before making change to production
	- Confirm a backout (revert) plan
- Backout plan
	- Change might not go well, always have a way to revert your changes
	- Some changes may be very difficult to revert
- Maintenance window - when is the change happening?
	- Might be the most difficult part of the process
	- Time of day, time of month, time of year
- Standard operating procedure
	- Change management is critical and must be well-documented
	- Changes to process itself must fit within standards
### Technical Change Management
- Put change management process into action
- Change management concerned with what, technical team handles the how
- Allow list / deny list - security policy controlling app execution
	- Allow list - nothing runs unless it's approved 
	- Deny list - everything runs unless it's disapproved (i.e. anti-malware)
- Restricted activities
	- Scope of a change is critical
	- Change approval is permission only for specific changes
	- Scope may need to be expanded
	- Change management process determines next steps
- Downtime
	- Services will be eventually unavailable, usually done during non-business hours
	- If possible, prevent any downtime, switch to secondary system
		- Should be as automated as possible, part of backout plans
	- Send email notifications and calendar updates
- Restarts - common requirement
	- Reboot OS, power cycle switch, bounce service
	- Services - stop and restart service or daemon
	- Application - close completely
- Legacy applications
	- Been around a while, often no longer supported
	- Document the system, may be quirky
- Dependencies - may add complexity
	- To complete A, you must complete B
	- Libraries, other applications, etc.
	- Modifying one component may require modifying/restarting several others
- Documentation
	- New changes require new processes and documentation
	- Updating diagrams (network, etc.)
	- Updating policies and procedures
- Version control
	- Track changes to a file or config data over time
	- Router configs, Windows patches, application registry entries, etc.
	- Some devices/suites provide this , some need additional software
