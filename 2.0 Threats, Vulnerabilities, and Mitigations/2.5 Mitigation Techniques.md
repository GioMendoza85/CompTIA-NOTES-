Full objective: "Explain the purpose of mitigation techniques used to secure the
enterprise."

### Segmentation and Access Control
- Segmenting the network
	- Physical, logical, of virtual (devices, VLANs, virtual networks)
	- To get...
		- Performance (high-bandwidth apps)
		- Security (isolation)
		- Compliance
- Access control lists (ACLs)
	- Allow or disallow traffic
	- Restrict access to network devices
	- List the permissions
		- User X can access resource Y through port Z
	- Many OSs use ACLs for file access
- Application allow/deny list
	- Any app can be dangerous, security policy can control app execution
	- Allow list - nothing runs unless approved (more restrictive)
	- Deny list - everything runs unless disapproved
	- Examples
		- Decisions are built in to OSs
		- Application hash (allow only with unique identifier)
		- Certificate (allow digitally signed apps from certain publishers)
		- Path (only run apps in these folders)
		- Network zone (only run from this zone)
### Mitigation Techniques
- Patching
	- Incredibly, incredibly important
	- Monthly incremental updates
	- Third-party updates
	- Auto-update (not always the best, patch testing may be necessary)
	- Emergency (out-of-band) updates might be necessary
- Encryption
	- Prevent access to app data files
	- File level encryption (Windows EFS)
	- Full disk encryption (FDE) - encrypt everything (BitLocker, etc.)
	- Application Data encryption - managed by app
- Monitoring
	- Aggregate information from devices, integrated
	- Sensors - IPS, firewalls, auth logs, etc.
	- Collectors - IPS, firewalls, SIEM tools, etc.
- Principle of Least Privilege
	- Rights and permissions set to bare minimum for functionality
	- All user accounts must be limited
	- Don't allow users to run with admin privileges
- Configuration enforcement
	- Perform a posture assessment each time a device connects (latest OS, patch, etc.)
	- Systems out of compliance are quarantined
- Decommissioning
	- Should be a formal policy, don't throw data into trashed
	- Mostly associated with storage devices (HDD, SSD, USB stick, etc.)
	- Recycle or destroy (FUBAR)
### Hardening Techniques
- System hardening
	- Lost of systems, lots of variety
	- Updates (system, service packs)
	- User accounts (passwords, limitations)
	- Network access and security
	- Monitor and secure (anti-x)
- Encryption (prev.)
	- Encrypt all network communication (VPN)
- The endpoint - individual devices
	- The user's access (apps and data)
	- Stop the attackers (inbound/outbound)
	- Many different platforms
	- Protection is multi-faceted, practice defense in depth
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
	- Detect by signatures, behavioral analysis
	- Lightweight agent
	- Can investigate and determine root cause of threat
	- Respond to threat (isolate, rollback, etc.)
	- Driven by API - no intervention required
- Host-based firewall
	- Software-based (personal, runs on every endpoint)
	- Allow/disallow incoming or outgoing app traffic
	- Identify and block unknown processes
	- Manage centrally
- Finding intrusions
	- Host-based IPS (HIPS)
		- Recognize and block known attacks
		- Secure OS and app configs
		- Built into endpoint protection software
	- HIPS identification
		- Sigs, heuristics, behavioral
		- Buffer overflows, reg updates, writing files to sensitive folders
		- Access to non-encrypted data
- Open ports and services
	- Every open port is a possible entry point (least privilege, close most)
	- Control access with firewall (NGFW ideal)
	- Unused or unknown services - be wary
	- Applications with broad port ranges (more than 3 or 4) are suspicious
	- Use Nmap or similar port scanner
- Default password changes
	- All network devices and most apps have a management interface
	- Important to change defaults, these are widely available
	- Add MFA or third-party auth
- Removal of unnecessary software
	- All software contains bugs, some vulnerabilities
	- Every application has a different patching process
	- Remove all unused software to reduce risk
